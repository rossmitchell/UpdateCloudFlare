This is a small repo that will allow cloudflare to be used as a dynamic DNS.

The original idea for this came from [Scott Helme CloudFlareDDNS repo](https://github.com/ScottHelme/CloudFlareDDNS), however it didn't quite do what I needed it for, so I have re-created it here.

I also wanted to play around with a couple of frameworks and this was as good a project for that as any.
