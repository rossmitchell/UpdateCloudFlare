This is a small repo that will allow cloudflare to be used as a dynamic DNS.

The original idea for this came from [Scott Helme CloudFlareDDNS repo](https://github.com/ScottHelme/CloudFlareDDNS), however it didn't quite do what I needed it for, so I have re-created it here.

I also wanted to play around with a couple of frameworks and this was as good a project for that as any.

This now has two basic commands to update all of the sub domains and a named one.

Still need to do the following

 * Create a command to write the config file
 * Add a dist config file
 * Document what is here
 * Test the functions that can be tested
