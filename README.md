This is a small repo that will allow cloudflare to be used as a dynamic DNS.

The original idea for this came from [Scott Helme CloudFlareDDNS repo](https://github.com/ScottHelme/CloudFlareDDNS), however it didn't quite do what I needed it for, so I have re-created it here.

I also wanted to play around with a couple of frameworks and this was as good a project for that as any.

This is in the middle of being refactored at the moment, so won't work at all until that is complete 

Still need to do the following

 * Create a command to write the config file
 * Add a dist config file
 * Document what is here
 * Test the functions that can be tested
